App to help track inventory

Watch My Stuff if an inventory tracking app made using Flutter in Android Studio. It uses firebase to store the registered users and their corresponding inventory items. The app's main goal is to help users keep track of any items they may have, and their quantities. It is supposed to be more tailored towards businesses with large amounts of inventory, but it can also be easily used for personal reasons. 

NOTE: There was an add and maintatin orders function that I wanted to implement. It would allow users to create orders that would have to go out, and once they "satisfy" the order, the order would be deleted along with the adjusting the quantity of whatever items were included in the order. Unfortunately I had issues with the firebase firestore doc ids and had to scrap the function in order to finish the rest of the app. I hope to be able to figure out the issues I had and update the app with the function.

NOTE: My initial app idea was a calorie tracking app, but the idea of an inventory tracking app that could help people like my uncle with their businesses was more appealing to me. I switched app ideas fairly early into development so it was not much of a hassle to start over.
